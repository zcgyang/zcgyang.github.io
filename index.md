# About Me


Here is **Zhen Yang (杨真)**.

I am currently an embedded software engineer at Zhiyuan Research Institute (state key laboratory), after receiving my master's degree in mechanic engineering from Beihang University in January 2023.

**<font color='red'> [Highlight] </font> I am looking for a PhD position in Robotics or related fireld in 2024. Contact me if you have any leads!**

For more information, you can check my [CV](/file/CV-Zhen%20Yang-online.pdf).
